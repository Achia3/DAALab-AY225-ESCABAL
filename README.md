# DAA Lab - AY 2024-2025

A collection of **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** laboratory programs implemented as part of the Academic Year 2025-2026 curriculum. This repository contains solutions for various algorithmic problems, focusing on time complexity, sorting, searching, and graph theory.

## 🚀 Lab Programs Included

### 1. Searching Techniques
* **Linear Search & Binary Search:** Implementation to find elements in an array and analyze the number of comparisons for varying values of `n`.

### 2. Array & Mathematical Operations
* **Sum of Array:** Calculating the sum of elements with time complexity plotting.
* **Binary Converter:** Finding the binary equivalent of a decimal number.
* **Matrix Filtering:** Reading a matrix and printing only even elements.

### 3. Sorting Algorithms
* **Bubble Sort & Selection Sort:** Sorting "goods packages" based on integer labels.
* **Merge Sort:** Sorting a library database of books by ISBN.
* **Quick Sort:** Sorting file records based on unique IDs.
* **Heap Sort:** Sorting candidate resumes based on rank.

### 4. String Matching
* **Horspool's Algorithm:** Locating patterns within a string with algorithm tracing and complexity analysis.

### 5. Graph & Network Algorithms
* **Warshall’s Algorithm:** Finding the transitive closure of a network.
* **Floyd’s Algorithm:** Finding the shortest paths between all pairs of cities.
* **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:** Single-source shortest path for weighted connected graphs.
* **Kruskal’s Algorithm:** Finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for electrical layouts.
* **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Determining node reachability in a digraph.

### 6. Dynamic Programming
* **0/1 Knapsack Problem:** Finding the subset of items for maximum profit within a weight capacity.

## 📊 Performance Analysis
Many programs in this repository include logic to:
* Measure execution time for varying input sizes ($n$).
* Generate data points for plotting Time Complexity graphs.
* Provide step-by-step traces for complex algorithms.
