This project implements a Bubble Sort algorithm optimized to sort numerical datasets in descending order. It includes a performance timer and a utility to read data directly from a text file.

Features:


Descending Order Logic: Specifically modified to place the largest values at the beginning of the list.

Early Exit Optimization: Uses a swapped flag to stop the algorithm if the list becomes sorted before all passes are complete, improving performance on partially sorted data.

Performance Tracking: Returns the exact time taken (in seconds) to complete the sort.

File Handling: Includes a robust reader to ingest datasets from .txt files.

How to run:

must have a txt file named "dataset" inside the folder 
Run in terminal
